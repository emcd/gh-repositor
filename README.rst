Simple way to create new Github repositories with a preferred configuration.
For personal use.

I know Python well, but was feeling lazy, so I coached OpenAI's GPT 4 language
model on writing the Github repository creator. The `ChatGPT transcript
<http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/emcd/gh-repositor/blob/master/chat-gpt-github-repo-automation.html>`_
shows that I spent more time providing feedback on the code than if I had
just written it myself. But, it was fun.
